# Yosemite_wildfire_hydrology

## Summary
This repository houses the code for my Capstone Project for Yale's Energy Studies Program. This 
project takes a data-driven approach to analyze how Yosemite Valley water quality and
quantity has varied over the past 10 years in relation to the pervasive forest fires of north and
central California. Human activity over the past century that has accelerated climate change, and
in addition to frequent human-caused ignitions, has led to an increase in the spread, magnitude,
and duration of wildfires in California. Previous research has shown that in the wake of a forest
fire, the burning of local vegetation pollutes water sources and leads to myriad short- and
long-term water system issues (EPA). These negative consequences strain local ecosystems as
well as municipal water resources.

## Research Description
This research uses qualitative and statistical techniques to uncover relations between the US
Geological Survey's (USGS) Hydrology and Weather service datasets and the National
Interagency Fire Center's (NIFC) Wildland Fire Locations Full History datasets. The data
analysis stage will consist of exploration and visualization to portray trends across time and
locations. This research and analysis aims to yield an objective report on how Yosemite Valley’s
current water systems have been impacted by regional forest fires to highlight the effects they
have on whole ecosystems.

## Aims
The analysis aims to answer the following key research questions:
1. How has Yosemite Valley’s water quality and quantity changed in the past decade?
2. How much change in Yosemite Valley’s water quality and quantity can be attributed to
forest fires in the Pacific Northwest?
3. How do our conclusions regarding the impact of forest fires on water quality and quantity
in Yosemite Valley extend to the greater California region?
